                        <p>Community-Helpers give residents a better opportunity to connect with neighbors, parents, and senior citizens. By encouraging members to participate, volunteer, and work, we are developing a better environment where our children can grasp the importance of hard work. Organizations can come together and hire many helpers to improve the park, or clean up a highway. Children are also encouraged to get out of the house more and contribute to their community in a way that is beneficial for both parties.
